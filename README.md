# DS340W_Final_Project: Fraud Detection Model - Credit Card Transactions
## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The system leverages multiple sampling strategies, ensemble learning methods, and various machine learning models to effectively detect fraudulent activities while handling the inherent class imbalance in financial transaction data.

### Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization
- Multiple Sampling Strategies: Implements SMOTE, Random Undersampling, and Bayesian Optimization to address class imbalance
- Advanced ML Models: Utilizes LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost classifiers
- Ensemble Techniques: Combines models through Voting, Stacking, and Blending for improved performance
- Comprehensive Evaluation: Includes multiple metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) and visualizations
- Feature Engineering: Calculates transaction distances and extracts temporal features
